What's the best strengthening exercise
for seniors? Without a doubt, it's the
squat. Why? Because it's something you
already do every single day. Getting up
from a chair, sitting down on the
toilet, bending to pick up something you
dropped, reaching into a low cabinet.
All of these involve some form of
squatting. It's not just an exercise.
It's a functional movement that keeps
you living independently.
But for many seniors, squatting can feel
impossible. Maybe your knees ache. Maybe
your hips are stiff. Maybe your back has
been bothering you for years. Or maybe a
doctor once told you, "Don't squat." And
you took that to mean never not
realizing there are safe and gentle ways
to squat that won't hurt your joints.
Hi, I'm Dr. Dave Candy. I've worked with
hundreds of older adults, helping them
move better, feel stronger, and live
fuller lives. In this video, I'll guide
you through three safe and effective
squat variations, starting from the
easiest form, even if you have arthritis
or pain, and building up as your body
gets stronger. If you've ever struggled
to stand up or feared falling, this is
for you.
Let's begin with the very first step.
Why squats are the most important
strengthening exercise for seniors.

you. If you enjoy this video, type one

most important strengthening exercise
for seniors.
As we age, maintaining independence
becomes one of the greatest gifts we can
give ourselves. And strength is the
foundation of that freedom. Among all
exercises that support strength and
mobility, squats stand alone at the top.
Why? Because squats mimic real life
movements that older adults perform
every single day. Getting out of a
chair, using the toilet, stepping out of
a car, bending down to tie your shoes or
pick something off the floor. All of
these rely on your ability to perform a
squatting motion. When that ability
begins to decline, so does the ability
to live independently.
But this isn't just about movement. It's
about preserving dignity. As a physical
therapist, I once treated a patient
named Walter, a 78-year-old retired
teacher who came to me after a fall. He
told me he felt embarrassed that he
couldn't get off the couch without help
anymore. His knees hurt and he thought
that meant squats were off limits. "My
doctor told me not to squat," he said.
"But what Walter and many seniors don't
realize is that avoiding squats doesn't
protect you. It accelerates weakness.
The real issue is how you squat, not
whether you should.
With proper technique and modifications
tailored to aging joints, squats can
strengthen the muscles around your hips,
thighs, and core, helping to stabilize
your knees, protect your spine, and
reduce your risk of falls. They also
improve circulation, and preserve bone
density. Especially important for those
living with osteopenia or osteoporosis.
Squatting correctly actually protects
your joints far more than inactivity
ever will.
There's a simple truth here. The ability
to squat is the ability to rise. To rise
from a chair, from a bed, from a low
point in your day or your life. And it's
never too late to reclaim that ability.
But I understand that not everyone feels
safe going into a deep squat right away.
Especially if you're dealing with
arthritis, back pain, or just haven't
exercised in years. The good news is
there are safer, gentler ways to start.
You don't need a gym or fancy equipment.
You only need your body, a sturdy chair,
and a willingness to begin.
Curious how to start? Let me introduce
you to the mini squat. A gentle standing
movement that's perfect for beginners,
especially those with joint pain. This
might be the small step that helps you
take back your strength.

these insights helpful, please comment

number two. Two, mini squat. A gentle
standing squat for beginners or those
with joint pain.
For many older adults, the idea of doing
a squat can feel intimidating, even
frightening. Perhaps you've had knee
pain for years, or maybe your doctor
once told you to avoid squats entirely.
It's easy to assume that squats are for
younger, athletic people. But the truth
is, there's a version of the squat
that's made for you, a movement so
simple and safe that it can help you
regain confidence without causing pain.
That's the mini squat. and it might just
become your most important daily habit.
The mini squat is exactly what it sounds
like, a small controlled bend of the
knees while standing designed to
strengthen your legs and hips without
straining your joints. It doesn't
require going deep. It doesn't require
equipment. What it does require is care,
good form, and a little patience.
I remember working with a patient named
Marlene, an 82-year-old widow who lived
alone. She had been avoiding stairs and
standing for too long because of chronic
knee arthritis. I feel like my legs are
fading away, she told me. We started
with mini squats, just a few twice a
day, focusing on her hip movement rather
than forcing her knees. Within a few
weeks, Marlene could rise from her
recliner more easily. She didn't need to
brace herself with both arms. That small
motion gave her back something she
thought was gone. Stability and
independence.
The key to the mini squat is alignment
and intention. You begin by standing
with your feet about hipwidth apart,
toes pointing slightly out if that feels
natural to your body. Instead of bending
your knees straight down, think about
gently pushing your hips backward like
you're starting to sit in an invisible
chair. Keep your chest up, your back
straight, and your weight centered in
your heels. Even a shallow 3 to 5 in
bend is effective when done correctly.
You'll feel your thigh muscles activate
and your glutes engage, all without
compressing your knees.
From a medical perspective, this
movement is gold. It builds strength in
the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutial
muscles, all of which support knee
health, improve posture, and help
prevent falls. For those with arthritis,
the mini squat avoids the deep flexion
that often triggers discomfort, allowing
you to build strength around the joint
in a protective way.
And don't worry if your legs feel shaky
at first. That's just your body waking
up again.
So, what's next? After you've mastered
this gentle standing squat, the next
step takes you from standing to seated
and back again with a movement that's
both familiar and incredibly important
for everyday life. Three, squatting from
a chair, training the ability to sit
down and stand up with strength and
control.
If you've ever struggled to get up from
a soft couch or needed an extra push off
the armrest to rise from your favorite
recliner, you already know how essential
this movement is. Squatting from a chair
is not just an exercise, it's a life
skill. And for older adults, it's one of
the most meaningful ways to maintain
independence and his safety and dignity
at home.
This simple motion of sitting down and
standing up requires a coordinated
effort of the legs, hips, and core. But
over time, due to joint pain, muscle
loss, or fear of falling, it becomes
harder to do without strain or support.
That's why practicing this as an
exercise, not just a habit, is so
powerful. It trains your body to move
with intention, balance, and strength.
I think of George, an 86-year-old Navy
veteran who came to see me after a minor
fall in his kitchen. I didn't trip, he
told me. I just couldn't get my legs
under me fast enough to catch myself.
George had stopped squatting completely
because of chronic hip discomfort and
he'd started avoiding deep chairs
altogether. We began with assisted chair
squats, feet flat, heels tucked slightly
under the knees, hands gently resting on
the thighs. I taught him to lean forward
slightly at the hips, keeping his spine
straight, then use his leg and core
strength to push himself upright. Slowly
over the course of a few weeks, he
needed less support and stood taller
with each repetition. The day he stood
up from his favorite low armchair
without help, he smiled like he'd won a
medal.
Medically, this movement strengthens the
quadriceps, glutial muscles, and trunk
stabilizers. It also reinforces
neuromuscular control, your brain's
connection with your body, so that
reaction time and balance improve
naturally. Practicing this motion builds
not only muscle but trust in your body.
Again,
what's crucial here is alignment. Your
knees should track in the same direction
as your toes, never collapsing inward.
If you naturally stand with your toes
turned slightly out, that's perfectly
fine. Your goal is to keep the hips,
knees, and ankles in a straight path,
forming a solid pillar of support. Scoot
toward the edge of the chair. Plant your
feet. Lean forward slightly and rise
with control. On the way down, reverse
that motion slowly, using the same
muscles to guide you rather than letting
gravity take over.
Once you can do this safely and
confidently, you'll feel the difference.
Not just in your legs, but in your daily
life. Getting out of bed becomes easier.
So does using the bathroom or stepping
out of the car. This is more than
exercise. It's freedom in motion.
And if you're one of the more active
seniors who already does this with ease,
well, it's time we take it up a notch
and explore the next level.

number four.
Four traditional squats for the strong,
active senior ready to push further.
There comes a time in your health
journey when you don't just want to
maintain your strength, you want to
build it. For seniors who are active,
mobile, and looking to stay ahead of age
related decline, traditional squats
offer a powerful way to reinforce the
foundation of your body. This isn't
about bodybuilding or pushing heavy
weights at the gym. This is about
preserving mobility, enhancing balance,
and protecting your joints by keeping
your muscles strong, flexible, and
responsive.
Traditional squats challenge multiple
major muscle groups at once: quadriceps,
glutes, hamstrings, and core, all while
improving bone density and
cardiovascular endurance. When performed
with proper form and intention, they
become one of the most complete
exercises for older adults. But what
matters most is not how deep you go or
how much weight you carry. It's how well
you move and how well you listen to your
body.
One of my patients, Lillian, a
72-year-old retired nurse, came to me
after completing a rehab program for a
hip replacement. She had recovered
remarkably well and was walking without
any aid, but she wanted to do more than
just walk. She wanted to hike again with
her daughter in the Blue Ridge
Mountains. We started working on
traditional squats with just her body
weight. I taught her how to find her
natural stance, feet slightly wider than
hips, toes turned gently out, and
coached her to push her hips back before
bending the knees. By focusing on
sitting back rather than bending down,
she engaged her glutes and protected her
knees. We added light dumbbells at her
chest as her strength grew. Within
weeks, her posture improved, her stride
became more confident, and she reported
less stiffness in her back and hips.
From a medical standpoint, the benefits
of squats at this level are significant.
They promote joint lubrication, activate
stabilizing muscles that prevent falls,
and help regulate blood sugar.
Especially valuable for seniors with
pre-diabetes or mild hypertension. For
those with osteopenia or osteoporosis,
using moderate resistance while
maintaining a neutral spine can help
maintain or even improve bone mass in
the hips and spine.
The key is mindfulness. Your knees
should always follow the angle of your
toes. Your back should remain long and
straight. And you should never sacrifice
form for depth. Using a chair behind you
as a safety net or holding onto a
countertop can add security until you're
confident moving freely.
If you've reached this point in your
strength journey, you're doing more than
most your age. You're investing in a
future with fewer limitations and more
joy. And you might be wondering, where
do we go from here?
Well, what happens after the exercise is
just as important. Let's talk about how
to recover, protect your joints, and
nourish your muscles as you age with the
same intention and care you put into
every movement.
Strength is not about youth. It's about
will.
Aging is not about giving up. It's about
adapting, listening, and moving with
purpose. The squat in all its forms,
from the gentle mini squat to the
powerful traditional stance, is more
than an exercise. It is a symbol of
resilience. It is a return to what your
body was designed to do, to bend, to
rise, and to move through life with
confidence.
Too often, older adults are told to take
it easy, as if strength and progress are
things of the past. But the truth is the
human body continues to respond to
movement, to effort, and to care, even
into our 70s, 80s, and beyond. I've seen
it time and again. A patient in their
90s walking taller after a few weeks of
consistent practice. A grandmother
lifting her grandchild without fear. A
veteran rediscovering his balance and
pride.
These are not exceptions. These are
possibilities, real, reachable, and
yours if you choose them.
Every version of the squat serves a
purpose. The mini squat reintroduces
your body to movement with gentleness
and control. The chair squat brings that
strength into your daily function, your
ability to rise and sit with grace. And
the traditional squat challenges your
endurance and helps rebuild what time
has taken. But none of these matter
without your willingness to begin.
If you followed along this far, you've
already done something powerful. You've
invested in yourself. You've shown that
your future matters, that you're not
settling for decline. And that is the
very mindset that keeps people healthy,
mobile, and full of life well into their
later years.
From a medical standpoint, consistent
lower body strength training improves
joint stability, reduces fall risk,
enhances bone health, and supports
metabolic wellness. From a personal
standpoint, it brings back something
many seniors quietly long for,
independence. The ability to move freely
in your own home, to climb stairs
without fear, to live life on your own
terms.
So, here's what I'll leave you with.
It's not about how low you go or how
many reps you do. It's about showing up,
doing what you can, and building one
small victory at a time. Because
strength isn't measured by weightlifted.
It's measured by the courage to keep
moving forward.
If you found this helpful, I invite you
to keep learning with me. There's so
much more to share about movement, about
healing, and about how to stay strong at
every age because your best years still
have something to say.
These lessons are meant to inspire you
to live fully and authentically. Now,
I'd love to hear from you. Take a moment
to reflect and share one thing you've
learned and plan to apply in your own
life. Let's support each other on this
journey toward embracing these truths.
