If you're over 60, this message could
save your life.
Stroke rarely gives you a second chance.
One moment you feel fine reading the
paper, sipping your morning coffee, and
the next your arm won't move, your
speech is slurred, or your world spins
out of control. As a brain doctor, I've
seen far too many seniors suffer
devastating strokes. Not from bad luck
or poor lifestyle, but from a simple
habit they believed was helping them.
Drinking baking soda water.
Every day, millions of older adults
across America mix a little baking soda
into water, thinking it will ease
digestion, cleanse the body, or balance
pH. But what no one tells you is that
this small ritual, especially when done
daily, can silently damage your kidneys,
throw off your blood chemistry, and even
spike your stroke risk overnight.
In this video, I'll reveal the shocking
science behind baking soda's hidden
effects on the aging brain and body.
You'll hear real patient stories, learn
why natural doesn't mean safe, and most
importantly, discover what you should do
instead.
Stay with me because the glass of water
in your kitchen may be quietly putting
your life at risk while you sleep.

in the comments. If not, type zero to
let me know how I can make better
content for you. One, a sudden spike in
blood sodium levels.
You've likely heard it said, "It's just
baking soda. What harm could it do?"
That very thought crosses the minds of
thousands of older Americans each
morning or evening as they stir a
spoonful into warm water. They believe
they're helping their digestion,
detoxifying their bodies, or even
balancing their pH. But what they don't
see, what I see as a brain doctor, are
the catastrophic consequences that
unfold quietly inside their bloodstream.
All because of one silent ingredient,
sodium.
Baking soda is made of sodium
bicarbonate, assault. Just one teaspoon
contains about 1/200 milligrams of
sodium. That's over half the recommended
daily limit for older adults, especially
those with heart disease, high blood
pressure, or kidney issues. Now, imagine
adding that to your daily routine
without realizing that you're spiking
your blood sodium every single time.
In a younger body, the kidneys work like
well-trained gatekeepers, filtering
excess sodium efficiently. But for older
adults, kidney function gradually
declines, even without noticeable
symptoms. When too much sodium builds
up, the blood thickens, blood pressure
climbs, and the delicate arteries in the
brain are forced to tighten and strain.
For some, that pressure becomes
unbearable and it gives way.
I'll never forget Mr. James Holloway,
82, a retired male carrier from Idaho.
He was the picture of discipline, still
walked every morning, ate oatmeal for
breakfast, and proudly avoided processed
food. But for over a year, he drank a
glass of water with baking soda each
night to help with mild indigestion. He
never smoked, never drank. He thought he
was doing everything right.
Then one morning, he didn't wake up
normally.
His wife found him in bed,
half-conscious, unable to move his left
side. At the hospital, we discovered he
had suffered a hypertensive stroke
overnight. His sodium levels were
dangerously high and his blood vessels,
especially in the brain, had become
rigid and inflamed. The excess sodium
had created a pressure cooker inside his
own body.
He survived, but not without
consequences. He lost the ability to
walk without assistance, and his
short-term memory was never the same.
The saddest part, he had no idea that
his evening remedy was slowly turning
into a neurological time bomb.
The danger isn't just in the ingredient,
it's in the timing, the repetition, and
the age of the body. At 30, you might
tolerate a sodium spike. At 70 or 80,
that same spike can trigger a brain
bleed while you sleep. No warning, no
headache, just silence, and then a life
forever altered.
And once it happens, there's no rewind
button. The cost isn't just your speech,
your ability to walk, or your
independence. It's the quiet horror of
waking up one morning and not
recognizing the face in the mirror. It's
the burden it places on your spouse,
your children, your caregivers, all from
a teaspoon of something you thought was
safe.
Now, if that makes you stop and think,
it should,
because what happens after sodium
overload is even more dangerous.
When your body starts to lose control of
its chemistry and the electrolyte
imbalance kicks in, it doesn't just
attack your heart or your kidneys.
It goes straight to your brain.
If you're still watching and finding
these insights helpful, please comment
number one below to let me know you're

number two.
Two, electrolyte imbalance leading to
dizziness, seizures, or minor stroke.
The human brain is a masterpiece,
electrically charged, constantly in
motion, and deeply sensitive to even the
smallest chemical shifts. And yet, many
seniors unknowingly tip this delicate
balance every time they drink a glass of
water laced with baking soda. It may
sound harmless, even healthconscious.
But here's what I need you to
understand. When you flood your body
with baking soda, you're not just
changing your digestion, you're altering
your entire internal chemistry.
Baking soda increases alkalinity in the
blood. For a healthy adult in a
controlled clinical setting, that might
be acceptable in rare circumstances. But
in older adults whose bodies process
things slower, whose kidneys can no
longer filter efficiently, and whose
nervous systems are more fragile, this
shift can cause a dangerous state called
metabolic alkyossis,
a condition where your blood becomes too
alkaline.
That sounds technical, but the
consequences are painfully real.
Let me tell you about Mrs. Clara
Thompson, age 79, a retired elementary
school teacher from Wisconsin. She had a
lovely habit of herbal teas, stretching
in the mornings, and staying away from
processed food. But when a friend
suggested baking soda water for her
heartburn, she began taking it nightly
without any idea that she was slowly
unraveling her own neurological
stability.
After two months, Clara began
experiencing waves of dizziness, the
kind that made her cling to the hallway
walls. Then came muscle twitching, like
sparks firing under her skin. And one
day in the grocery store, she collapsed
without warning. Her eyes rolled back
and her body seized for 20 seconds.
She had suffered a neurological event,
something between a seizure and a
minstroke. At the hospital, her blood
tests showed a critical drop in
potassium levels, and a sharp rise in
blood alkalinity, classic signs of
baking soda induced metabolic
alkalossis.
Here's what happened inside her. The
baking soda had altered her electrolyte
levels so severely that nerve signals to
the brain and muscles were misfiring
like static on a phone line. Her body
trying to adjust had spiraled into
dysfunction.
The worst part, she told me tearfully,
"I thought I was doing something gentle,
something safe."
That's the danger. It feels natural
until the damage is done.
The price Clara paid. She now lives with
permanent balance issues, can no longer
drive, and has to be accompanied by her
daughter to avoid fall risks. One sip at
a time, she had unwittingly shaken the
very chemistry that kept her upright,
steady, and independent.
The older we get, the less room we have
for error. Even minor shifts in sodium,
potassium, or bicarbonate levels can
spark confusion, weakness, or even
unconsciousness.
Your body is no longer forgiving.
And if you think the danger ends there,
think again.
Because once the electrolyte imbalance
starts, your kidneys are the next to
suffer. And that damage, though often
silent at first, can create a chain
reaction that leads straight back to
your brain. And by the time symptoms
appear, the harm may already be done.
Three, kidney damage. The silent link
between baking soda and brain decline.
The kidneys are like the unsung heroes
of the body. Quietly working day and
night to keep everything balanced. They
filter waste, manage fluid levels,
regulate blood pressure, and maintain
the perfect balance of minerals and
chemicals in your bloodstream. But when
you're over 60, these vital organs don't
work as efficiently as they once did.
They're more vulnerable. They're slower
to respond. And most dangerously,
they're easier to overwhelm.
Now, imagine adding a daily dose of
baking soda, a chemical compound packed
with sodium, into that already delicate
system. You might feel fine at first,
but inside your body, stress is
building. Every teaspoon of baking soda
is a salt load the kidneys must handle.
And over time, that strain starts to
break them down cell by cell, silently.
I remember a patient named Walter Green,
age 84, a proud Korean War veteran from
Ohio. He came into my clinic complaining
of persistent fatigue, swelling in his
ankles, and occasional confusion. His
wife mentioned he'd been drinking baking
soda water twice a day for years,
believing it helped with gout and
digestion. He'd read online that it
could alkalize the blood.
What the internet didn't tell him is
that daily exposure to sodium
bicarbonate, especially in older adults,
can lead to long-term kidney stress.
When we ran his labs, the truth hit
hard. His creatinin levels were
elevated, a clear sign his kidneys were
struggling. His electrolytes were
imbalanced, and his blood pressure was
unpredictable, swinging between high and
dangerously low. But the most worrying
part, a brain scan revealed signs of
reduced perfusion, meaning his brain
wasn't getting the steady blood flow it
needed. The cause? A mix of kidney
related fluid retention, unstable blood
pressure, and narrowed arteries.
Walter had never had a stroke, but he
was teetering on the edge. His
short-term memory had begun to slip. He
forgot appointments, confused dates. He
even got lost once on his morning walk.
These weren't just signs of aging. They
were early symptoms of silent brain
injury fed by years of unchecked kidney
strain and poor circulation.
He looked at me and said, "Doc, I
thought I was doing something right."
That's the tragedy. He wasn't reckless.
He was trying to stay healthy, but no
one had warned him that the kidneys and
the brain are linked. When the kidneys
begin to fail, they throw off blood
pressure, create toxin buildup, and
deprive the brain of what it needs most,
oxygen, nutrients, and balance.
The price Walter paid, he now lives with
stage three chronic kidney disease and
must limit fluid intake, salt, even
certain vegetables. His independence is
reduced. he's had to stop driving and he
fears rightfully so that a full stroke
could be next.
If you're using baking soda regularly,
even just a little, your kidneys may be
paying the price quietly until it's too
late. And what starts in the kidneys
doesn't stay there. It ripples outward,
touching the brain, the heart, your
energy, your memory, and your future.
But the danger doesn't stop at what
baking soda does on its own.
What happens when you combine it with
your daily medications?
Because for many seniors, that
combination could be the most dangerous
cocktail of all.
If you're still watching and finding
these insights valuable, please comment
number one below to let me know you're

Now, let's keep going with point number
four.
Four, dangerous interactions with
medication.
It's one of the most overlooked dangers
in senior health, the quiet, hidden
interactions between over-the-counter
remedies and prescription medications.
And in my decades as a neurologist, few
substances surprise me more in this
regard than baking soda.
At first glance, it seems harmless. It's
not a pill. It's not a prescription.
It's sitting in the back of your pantry
next to the flour. But baking soda is a
powerful chemical compound that
dramatically alters the pH level of your
blood and stomach. That one change can
cause a ripple effect, interfering with
how medications are absorbed,
metabolized, and even eliminated from
your body.
Most older Americans take multiple
prescriptions daily for blood pressure,
diabetes, cholesterol, blood thinners,
or heart conditions. That's normal and
often necessary. But what isn't often
discussed is how something as simple as
baking soda can make those medications
unpredictable, sometimes even deadly.
One of my patients, Mrs. Marlene
Douglas, age 76, a retired librarian
from Oregon, came to me after a fall in
her kitchen. She had hit her head on the
counter but couldn't remember how or why
she fainted. She had been on leis and
opal for blood pressure, metformin for
type 2 diabetes, and lowdosese aspirin
for stroke prevention, a fairly standard
regimen for someone her age.
But when we reviewed her habits,
something stood out. She had started
taking baking soda water every morning
to calm her stomach as suggested by a
neighbor. Unaware of the consequences,
she thought she was helping herself.
The truth was much darker. Baking soda
had increased the alkalinity of her
stomach, changing how her medications
were being absorbed. The lysin opal
stopped working effectively, causing
sudden surges in her blood pressure. The
aspirin's effect was amplified, thinning
her blood more than intended, and her
metformin. It became erratic, leading to
unstable blood sugar levels, which
likely contributed to her dizziness and
collapse.
She had unknowingly created a chemical
imbalance in her body that made her
carefully managed medication plan
completely unreliable.
One small cup of water each morning
laced with baking soda was undoing the
work of three essential prescriptions.
That fall cost her dearly. She suffered
a mild brain bleed, developed lingering
vertigo, and had to stop living alone
for the first time in her adult life.
She told me, "I just didn't know it was
only baking soda."
And that's the most dangerous part.
Because when you're over 65, your body
becomes far more sensitive to
interactions. The liver slows down, the
kidneys filter less efficiently, and
your blood vessels are less forgiving.
One unexpected reaction, just one, can
send you from a steady routine into an
emergency room.
And yet, people trust baking soda simply
because it doesn't come with a warning
label.
But that trust is often misplaced. And
now we come to perhaps the biggest
misconception of all. The one belief
that leads many seniors straight into
harm's way.
If it's natural, it must be safe.
But the truth about that idea might
shock you. Five. Misleading safety. The
danger of thinking it's natural.
We live in a time where the word natural
carries a certain comfort. It's on food
labels, vitamin bottles, skin creams,
and for many older adults, it suggests
something gentle, something safe. And
that's exactly where the danger lies.
Because in medicine, the most harmful
mistakes aren't always the ones made in
crisis. They're the ones made quietly
with good intentions day after day.
Baking soda feels safe. It's in your
kitchen. You baked cookies with it. Your
mother used it. You've seen people use
it for indigestion, for teeth whitening,
even to freshen the fridge. So when
someone says, "Add a teaspoon to water.
It's natural." It barely registers as a
health decision. But make no mistake,
baking soda is not a harmless home
remedy. It is a powerful, fast acting
chemical compound.
And for the aging body, that natural
remedy can become a silent threat.
One of my patients, Mr. Franklin Ellis,
81, a retired mechanic from Indiana,
came to my office complaining of
occasional chest tightness, fatigue, and
brain fog. He'd been proudly avoiding
pharmaceuticals, and had committed to
natural wellness. He drank green
smoothies, used essential oils, and had
started drinking baking soda water every
night after seeing a YouTube video that
claimed it would cleanse the blood.
By the time he came to me, his blood
pressure was erratic and lab tests
showed elevated sodium and altered pH
levels. But what shocked me most was his
EKG. It showed new onset atrial
fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat
that increases stroke risk by five
times. When we looked deeper, there was
no heart damage, no artery blockage, but
there was one constant daily ingestion
of baking soda over several months,
slowly pushing his body into chemical
imbalance.
Franklin was devastated. He said, "Doc,
I thought I was being smart. I just
didn't want more pills. But now he
needed blood thinners to prevent stroke,
heart monitoring, and had to stop
driving due to occasional dizziness. A
man who took pride in his independence
now had to rely on his daughter to read
his mail, manage his medication, and
cook his meals.
And all of it stemmed from a belief that
natural meant safe.
What many seniors don't realize is this.
Some of the most toxic substances in
medicine come from nature. Arsenic,
belladana, cyanide.
Natural means unprocessed. It doesn't
mean harmless. It doesn't mean good for
your body, especially a body that is
older, slower to recover, and more
sensitive to chemical shifts. Baking
soda is natural. So is lightning.
And that's why this conversation
matters. Not to scare you, but to wake
you up. Because a lifetime of wisdom
deserves better than blind trust in a
word on a label. It deserves
understanding. It deserves caution. It
deserves truth.
So, now that we've faced the five hidden
dangers of baking soda, sodium spikes,
electrolyte chaos, kidney stress, drug
interference, and the illusion of
safety, the question becomes, is there
any way to use it safely at all?
You might be wondering, if I still want
to use baking soda, how can I do it
without putting myself at risk?
Let's talk honestly about that next.
Six. So, how should seniors use baking
soda, if at all?
After hearing the dangers, high sodium
levels, chemical imbalances, kidney
strain, drug interactions, and the
illusion of safety, it's natural to ask,
is there any way to use baking soda
safely if I'm over 60?
It's a fair question. And as a
neurologist who works with aging adults
every day, I want to answer it honestly
and without fear-mongering.
The truth is baking soda can have
medical uses, but only in specific
temporary situations and only with
medical guidance. It is not meant for
long-term unsupervised daily use,
especially not for seniors whose bodies
process salt and chemicals very
differently than they did at age 30 or
40.
I once treated Mr. George Pritchard
Sepan, a retired postal worker from
Illinois. He'd read online that baking
soda helped with gout and began drinking
a small glass each morning. He was
diligent. Half a teaspoon dissolved in
warm water. He never smoked, watched his
diet. He even kept a journal of his
wellness routines.
But over 6 months, George began feeling
off. Slight chest pressure in the
morning, foggy thinking, increased
nighttime urination.
He chocked it up to aging until one
afternoon while playing cards with
friends. He slumped forward
mid-sentence. He hadn't had a stroke,
but a severe hypertensive episode. His
blood pressure had skyrocketed,
triggered by elevated sodium levels and
compromised kidney function.
What scared George the most wasn't the
ambulance ride or the hospital stay. It
was the realization that his small
healthy habit, a teaspoon a day, had
silently undermined his body's balance.
He told me in recovery, "All I wanted
was to avoid pills, but now I'm on five
of them."
So, what do I recommend?
If you're over 60 and considering using
baking soda for occasional indigestion
or reflux, here are the only safe
practices, and even these are not for
everyone.
Never exceed one/4 teaspoon at a time
diluted in at least eight o of water.
Never take it more than two to three
times per week.
Never take it before bed when your
kidneys are slower and blood pressure is
harder to regulate. Avoid completely if
you have high blood pressure, heart
disease, kidney issues, are on blood
thinners, or take medications that
affect electrolyte levels.
And above all, always ask your doctor
first. What seems minor to you may be
major to your body.
And let's be honest, if you're needing
baking soda that often, the issue isn't
acidity. It's the underlying cause that
needs to be addressed. Relying on baking
soda is like putting a wet towel on a
fire alarm. It may stop the noise, but
it does nothing for the flames.
Now, after everything we've uncovered,
you may be wondering one final thing.
Why didn't anyone tell me sooner?
And that answer takes us straight to the
most important truth of all. Awareness
is the medicine that saves lives.
If you've read this far, you are not
just curious. You are courageous. You're
someone who values truth more than
habit. Someone willing to question
long-held beliefs for the sake of your
health, your independence, and your
future.
As a doctor, I've seen far too many good
people, strong, loving, disciplined men
and women, lose their ability to speak,
to walk, to remember. Not because of one
big mistake, but because of small
choices repeated quietly over time. Like
a teaspoon of baking soda taken every
day in the name of wellness.
What you've learned today isn't about
fear. It's about power. The power to
choose wisely. The power to ask your
doctor the hard questions. The power to
protect your brain by understanding how
your body changes with age.
The truth is, when you're over 60, your
body isn't the same machine it once was.
Your kidneys are slower. Your blood
vessels are thinner. Your nervous system
is more sensitive. What once felt safe
may now carry hidden risks. And no one
will warn you unless you ask.
You don't need more pills. You don't
need more fads. What you need is
clarity, caution, and connection to real
food, to trusted guidance, and to your
own intuition.
So before you drink another glass with
baking soda just because, take a moment
to ask, is this really helping me or am
I gambling with my health?
The most powerful medicine you have left
isn't in your cabinet.
It's in your awareness.
And it starts the moment you decide to
listen.
Let this be that moment.
These lessons are meant to inspire you
to live fully and authentically. Now,
I'd love to hear from you. Take a moment
to reflect and share one thing you've
learned and plan to apply in your own
life. Let's support each other on this
journey toward embracing these truths.
